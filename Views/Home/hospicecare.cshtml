      <h3>Who Can Receive Hospice Care</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To be eligible for hospice services, individuals must meet the specific criteria set forth by Medicare:
          <ul>
            <li>A Medical Doctor must confirm a condition considered <strong>“Terminal”</strong> or <strong>“Life limiting”</strong>. The patient may still continue treatment for other unrelated conditions.</li>
            <li>The patient has either exhausted all aggressive treatment options or is no longer seeking curative treatment.</li>
            <li>The patient must choose to receive <strong>comfort-focused (palliative) care</strong> rather than aggressive intervention.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you or a loved one are facing concerns regarding a serious illness and wish to have the condition managed in the place you live, our team can help determine if the Medicare hospice benefit is the right option for you.

      <h3>What is Covered Under Hospice Care</h3>
      <p>
        Once hospice begins, Medicare or Medicaid covers all services related to your terminal illness and any associated conditions—as long as care is provided by a Medicare-approved hospice provider.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Covered Services Include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nursing services</li>
        <li>Hospice physician consultations</li>
        <li>Medical equipment (e.g., wheelchairs, walkers, oxygen tanks)</li>
        <li>Medical supplies (e.g., wipes, diapers, wound care supplies, catheters)</li>
        <li>Prescription medications for symptom relief</li>
        <li>Nursing aide and homemaker assistance (e.g., grooming, dressing, bathing)</li>
        <li>Physical and occupational therapy</li>
        <li>Speech-language pathology services</li>
        <li>Services from social workers and counselors</li>
        <li>Dietary and nutrition counseling</li>
        <li>Grief and loss support for patients and families</li>
        <li>Inpatient care for pain and symptom management, if needed</li>
        <li>Short-term respite care</li>
        <li>Additional services recommended by your hospice team as medically necessary</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We recommend you always ask about the best approach to managing your pain and symptoms under the hospice palliative umbrella—even if you choose not to proceed with hospice care.

    <div class="text-side">
      <h3>Who Pays for Hospice Care</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Medicare and Medicaid cover most of your hospice care costs with no deductible.
        </li>
        <li>
          You’ll continue paying your regular Medicare Part A and Part B premiums, which still apply to medical expenses unrelated to hospice services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Private insurance coverage may vary. Most plans cover hospice care with regular deductibles and co-pay structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you require room and board in a facility, Medicare covers the hospice benefit, while Medicaid may pay for the living expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you require hospital care due to your illness, your hospice provider must coordinate the admission for Medicare to cover the costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          A quick consult with a hospice representative can help determine whether a service is covered under the hospice benefit or will be billed through your regular insurance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The hospice company operates independently and does not mediate insurance policy terms. That relationship remains between you and your insurance carrier.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>Care from outside providers not coordinated by hospice</li>
        <li>Room and board (unless part of short-term respite or inpatient care)</li>

    <div class="text-side">
      <h3>Duration of Hospice Care</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hospice care is originally designed for individuals with a life expectancy of six months or less. However, terminal conditions can be unpredictable. Clients may continue receiving hospice care as long as the physician certifies that the terminal illness persists and the need for hospice care is justified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hospice care is divided into benefit periods:
          <ul>
            <li>Two initial 90-day periods</li>
            <li>Followed by unlimited 60-day periods</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You do not need to reapply or reselect hospice services each time—your hospice provider manages that process for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recertification by a physician is required at the end of every benefit period to continue receiving hospice care.
        </li>

      <h3>Stopping Hospice Care</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>You have the right to stop hospice services at any time</strong>—especially if your health improves or your illness goes into remission. If you choose to stop, your hospice provider will ask you to sign a form confirming the end date of care.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Only you can make the decision to stop hospice care.</strong> Never sign any forms unless you personally requested them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were on Medicare, you’ll continue with that coverage and can return to hospice care later if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were on a Medicare Advantage Plan, you can stay in the same plan and continue coverage—as long as you keep paying your plan’s premiums.
