      At Anarcare, we bring Physician ordered quality medical care directly to your home. Certain medical treatments and rehabilitative procedures that once required a hospital visit can now be provided where you’re most comfortable—at your home or wherever you live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Home health care is more convenient and affordable, while maintaining the standards and effectiveness of medical facilities.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to help patients recover from illness or injury, regain independence, and maintain or improve their daily function. Home health care supports your ability to live safely and confidently at home while helping prevent further health decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance covers home health care services if certain conditions are met. If you have Medicare or other insurance plans, check your plan or contact your provider to understand covered benefits.
